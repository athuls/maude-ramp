TODO: 
1) Check missing keys in txn
2) Get throughput from count in monitor (logs)
3) Run everything from one node
4) Don't need to run load/postload/txn separately

Start emulab experiment
- Use small-lan as your profile
- Use d710 machines
- Run setup.sh so that all dependencies are installed

Run server: 
- Login to server node (let's say node0)
- cd /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/ycsb_scripts
- Run run_server.sh script. 
  >> nohup sh run_server.sh <IP address info> &
  The argument <IP address info> is the host part of IP address of server node.  
  E.g. if IP address is 155.98.38.62, you pass in 62 as argument to script 

Load phase:
- cd /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/ycsb_scripts
- THe load config is available at /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/workloads/workloada_load
  THe records to load are assigned to recordcount parameter. Keep that and txnlen parameters the same. 
- sh load-ycsb.sh <list of IP address info of all server nodes, delimited by space>
  E.g. >> sh load-ycsb.sh 62 72 61
       Here the IP address of server nodes are 155.98.38.62, 155.98.38.72, 155.98.38.61
- Once the load at terminal shows all the records have been uploaded, you can stop the script using Ctrl+C

Run maude client:
- Login to client node (let's say node5)
- cd /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/ycsb_scripts
- >> bash run_client5.sh 63
- Do not close this terminal and open another terminal for this node (to do post load and transactions phases)
NOTE: If you want to run multiple instances of Maude client on a single client node
- Create multiple copies of init-client5.maude file. Say init-client5_0.maude, init-client5_1.maude...
- Now open init-client5_0.maude and set the N value in l(self,N) to 0 in line 46. Note that each will have unique value of N. 
  So init-client5_0.maude will have l(self,0) in line 46, init-client5_1.maude will have l(self,1) in line 46 and so on. 
- Now you pass a second argument to run_client5.sh file (in folder /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/ycsb_scripts) which is the client instance ID. So for running file init-client5_0.maude, you say
  >> bash run_client5.sh 63 0
- Note that each client instance should have a separate terminal 

Post load phase:
- From a terminal for the same machine that is running the client, cd /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/ycsb_scripts
- >> sh postload-ycsb.sh <list of IP address info of all server nodes, delimited by space> 
  E.g. >> sh load-ycsb.sh 62 72 61
  Here the IP address of server nodes are 155.98.38.62, 155.98.38.72, 155.98.38.61
- Give it a few seconds for post load to complete, then run kill script: 
  >> sh kill_postload.sh

Run transactions using ycsb:
- With the new architecture, each ycsb client now connects to one maude client, so the number of clients argument to run-ycsb script is always 1
- The timestamp argument is such that all ycsb clients (including those running on same node and those running on different nodes) have to start at same time. So put a timestamp that is about 3-4 minutes into the future so you get some time to start the ycsb clients on all the machines before the txn start time begins.
- >> nohup bash run-ycsb.sh <maude client IP address info> <maude client port number for txns> <#clients> <operation count> <start timestamp> > <log file> &
  E.g. nohup bash run-ycsb.sh 108 9910 1 1000 19:50:00 > /proj/Confluence/maude/debug_logs/temp/run.txt &  
  where 108 is the IP host address of the maude client (which would be 155.98.38.108 in this case)
  9910 is the port number on maude client opened for transactions  
  1 is the number of clients, this is fixed with our new setup
  1000 is the number of operations to generate
  19:50:00 is the time when txns have to start generating  

- Once you have set a time for transactions to start, you need to run another script to stop the transactions at a fixed time in the future (say one minute after the transactions started). Based onn the number of transactions completed in a minute, you can then compute the throughput
- >> nohup bash kill_ycsb.sh <time to stop txns> <client ID>
  E.g. nohup bash kill_ycsb.sh 19:51:00 5 &
  where node5 is the one where corresponding maude client is running and txns are to stop at 19:51:00
- NOTE: If you have multiple maude client instances on the same node, you need to pass a third argument to above script which is the instance ID of the maude client to kill

------------------------If you used kill_ycsb.sh already, you shouldn't need to explicitly kill maude client----------------
Kill maude client:
- Login back to the client node
- cd /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/ycsb_scripts
- sh kill_client.sh <node ID of client node>
  E.g. sh kill_client.sh 5 
- The logs for intermediate state can be found at /proj/Confluence/maude/debug_logs/temp/maude_client5_logs.txt

Kill maude server: 
- cd /users/nobi/ramp/maude-ramp/contrib/YCSB/ycsb_scripts
- sh kill_server.sh <server node ID>
  If the node you are running on server is node0 then pass 0 as argument 
- The logs can be found at /proj/Confluence/maude/debug_logs/temp/maude_server0_logs.txt
