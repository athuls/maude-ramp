1) [OPTIONAL] Extract the contents of compressed ramp-only.tar.gz file
2) Copy libsigar-amd64-linux.so from current directory into /usr/local/lib, if it is not already present there
3) Compile the ycsb code, only if needed. This is to be done if you make any code changes that you need to recompile the binaries for. 
   >> sudo apt-get install maven
   >> source ~/.bashrc  
   >> cd ramp-only/ramp-sigmod2014-code/contrib/YCSB
   >> sh compile_ycsb.sh

   Note that the .bashrc file is also backed up in the current folder as bashrc_backup
4) To run server, log into server node and then:
   >> cd ramp-only/ramp-sigmod2014-code
   >> java -XX:+UseParallelGC -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib -Dlog4j.configuration=file:./src/main/resources/log4j.properties -jar target/kaiju-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -kaiju_port 9810 -id 0 -cluster 155.98.36.121:9810 -thrift_port 8080 -isolation_level READ_ATOMIC -ra_algorithm KEY_LIST -max_object_size 16384 -drop_commit_pct 0 -check_commit_delay_ms -1

   Note that cluster argument contains the IP address of the server node and when you have multiple server instances that you want to run on separate nodes, you provide them as a comma separated list of arguments to -cluster argument above. You still have to run the above command on each of the server nodes.
5) Load operation. Log into client node and then:
   >> cd ramp-only/ramp-sigmod2014-code/contrib/YCSB
   >> sh load-ycsb.sh 155.98.36.121 
   
   Note that you can give multiple IP addresses as separate arguments to the load script, each IP address for a server node
   Also you may see the following exception which you can ignore: com.yahoo.ycsb.DBException: com.esotericsoftware.kryo.KryoException: java.net.SocketException: Socket closed 
  
6) To run client, log into client node and then:
   >> cd ramp-only/ramp-sigmod2014-code/contrib/YCSB
   >> sh run-ycsb.sh  
   
   Note that you need to update run-ycsb.sh with the server IP addr and port, e.g., hosts=155.98.36.121:8080 
   
   You can modify the arguments in the run-ycsb.sh script. 
   - hosts argument is the comma separated list of servers running (IP address and port number)
   - threads argument gives the number of threads to spawn for the YCSB client
